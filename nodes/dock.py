"""
Docking API for optional add-on packs.

Helpers kept deliberately stable, so an add-on pack can reuse the building
blocks here without having to take finished prompt strings apart again:

  - parse person_data
  - drop clothing fields from the value dict
  - reuse compose_person / detail_fuer_kamera

This module registers no nodes and holds no presets. Packs import it (or
person_builder) and keep their own lists themselves.
