"""
Photoshoot - a whole series of images from one click.

The person stays, everything else moves on: framing, posture, expression and
aspect ratio. The node hands out a different sentence per run and drives the
queue itself, from a button in its own interface (js/shooting.mjs).

Why not a batch: the conditioning is computed once and brought up to the batch
size with repeat_to_batch_size (comfy/utils.py:859) - all images in a batch
necessarily share the same prompt. 50 different images need 50 runs.

Why not random: across 50 photos some combination would come up three times and
another never. Instead the seed counts upwards and serves as the run index.
